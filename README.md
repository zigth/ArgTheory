# ArgTheory
A project on implementing Argumentation theory concepts in Prolog

argTheory.pl is the main file containing all functions for argumentation theory.
framework1-9.pl and rdm50_0.pl are files containing example frameworks which also automatically load argTheory.pl, 
and can thus be directly loaded and used as long as argTheory.pl is contained in the same folder.
